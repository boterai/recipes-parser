    "instructions": "Whisk flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Grate the frozen butter using a box grater. Add it to the flour mixture and combine with a pastry cutter, two forks, or your fingers until the mixture comes together in pea-sized crumbs. Whisk heavy cream, the egg, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. Drizzle over the flour mixture, add the add-ins, then mix together until everything appears moistened. Pour onto the counter and, with floured hands, work dough into a ball. Press into an 8-inch disc and cut into 8 wedges. Brush scones with remaining heavy cream and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Bake for 18-26 minutes or until golden brown around the edges.",
