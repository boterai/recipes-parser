Strain through a fine mesh sieve into another bowl and discard any seeds and pulp. In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, rice flour, turmeric, salt, fish sauce and Jalapeno pepper. Mix until well combined and shape the mixture into meatballs approximately 1-inch in diameter. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat and lightly brown on all sides; do not worry if they are not cooked through. Set aside on a plate. In the same skillet, add the ginger, garlic and onion and cook, stirring frequently, until the onions have softened. Add the lemongrass and cayenne and stir to mix. Add the tomatoes and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently and using your stirring utensil to mash the diced tomatoes. Return the meatballs to the skillet and add the tamarind liquid and the remaining 1 cup of water. Reduce heat to medium low and let the mixture simmer until the sauce has thickened. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve immediately.",
