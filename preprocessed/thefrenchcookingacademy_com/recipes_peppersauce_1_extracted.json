    "description": "There’s just something about a good pepper sauce that makes a simple steak (or even chicken) feel like a real treat. Not every sauce has to be a pan sauce that needs steak juices. The real magic is in the quality of your beef stock and the pepper—splurge on some single-origin stuff if you can! With a splash of cognac, a touch of cream, and plenty of black pepper, you’ll be ready to drizzle restaurant-level sauce over your next meal.",

    "step_by_step": "1. Heat your oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until it’s shimmering. Add the beef trimmings and brown them deeply on all sides—don’t rush this step; you want real color, which means real flavor. This usually takes about 10 minutes. Add the carrot, onion, mushrooms and celery. Drop the heat to medium and add your butter. Let everything sweat for a couple of minutes, stirring so nothing burns, just enough for the veg to soften and release their aromas. 2. Time for the cognac (or white): turn up the heat, add the cognac (carefully—stand back, and don’t flambe), and let it bubble away until almost evaporated, scraping up all those browned bits. Next, pour in your hot beef stock and add the thyme and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer and let it gently reduce roughly by about half (you should have 200 to 250 ml left)—this should take 10 -15 minutes and will concentrate all those meaty flavors. 3. Once reduced, strain the sauce into a clean pan and discard the solids. Thicken the sauce, by whisking in your beurre manié or cornstarch slurry and bring to a boil for a minute until it thickens to a semi syrupy consistency. When done follow by stirring in the cream, and simmer until the sauce reaches spoon costing consistency—it should take just a couple of minutes. 4. Finally add half the cracked black pepper and season with salt to taste. Simmer for another minute or two to infuse that peppery flavor. Taste and adjust with more pepper if you like or salt as you like (don’t be shy with the pepper—it’s pepper sauce!). 5. Serve hot over grilled, pan-seared, or roasted steaks—or whatever you fancy. It’s also pretty amazing with grilled chicken or even roasted veg.",

    "notes": "Try green peppercorns for a milder, slightly tangy twist. Make ahead: This sauce holds up well so t can be made a few hours in advance Fancy a twist? A splash of Madeira or brandy works if you’re out of cognac. Vegetarians can swap in a rich mushroom stock and skip the beef trimmings—still delicious!",
