Alternate adding dry ingredients and milk to butter mixture. Divide batter between pans and bake 25-30 minutes until golden and springy. Cool completely. 2. Drain ricotta in fine mesh strainer for 30 minutes. Combine drained ricotta with powdered sugar, citrus zests, and cinnamon. Fold in chocolate chips. Refrigerate filling for 30 minutes. 3. Slice each cake layer horizontally into two even layers. Brush each layer with orange liqueur and simple syrup mixture. Spread ricotta filling between layers, stacking evenly. Refrigerate assembled cake for 1 hour. 4. Whip chilled heavy cream with powdered sugar until stiff peaks form. Apply crumb coat to chilled cake and refrigerate 15 minutes. Apply final frosting layer and decorate with candied fruit and pistachios. 5. Refrigerate completed cake for at least 4 hours or overnight before serving.
