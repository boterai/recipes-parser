    "dish_name": "Einkorn Sourdough Pumpkin Scones",
    "description": "These sourdough discard pumpkin scones are tall and craggy with a soft, tender interior. The sweet pumpkin pairs incredibly well with the warm spices and nutty, wholesome whole-grain einkorn (or whole wheat).",
    "ingredients": "[{\"name\": \"whole einkorn flour\", \"units\": \"g\", \"amount\": 160}, {\"name\": \"all-purpose flour\", \"units\": \"g\", \"amount\": 160}, {\"name\": \"sugar\", \"units\": \"g\", \"amount\": 80}, {\"name\": \"sea salt\", \"units\": \"tsp\", \"amount\": 0.5}, {\"name\": \"cinnamon\", \"units\": \"tsp\", \"amount\": 1.5}, {\"name\": \"nutmeg\", \"units\": \"tsp\", \"amount\": 0.25}, {\"name\": \"ginger\", \"units\": \"tsp\", \"amount\": 0.5}, {\"name\": \"baking powder\", \"units\": \"g\", \"amount\": 16}, {\"name\": \"frozen butter\", \"units\": \"g\", \"amount\": 170}, {\"name\": \"raisins\", \"units\": \"g\", \"amount\": 80}, {\"name\": \"ripe sourdough starter\", \"units\": \"g\", \"amount\": 80}, {\"name\": \"egg\", \"units\": null, \"amount\": 1}, {\"name\": \"buttermilk\", \"units\": \"g\", \"amount\": 75}, {\"name\": \"pumpkin puree\", \"units\": \"g\", \"amount\": 110}, {\"name\": \"vanilla extract\", \"units\": \"tsp\", \"amount\": 1}, {\"name\": \"pumpkin spice\", \"units\": \"tsp\", \"amount\": 0.25}]",
    "instructions": "In a small bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients. In a large bowl, add the dry ingredients except for the butter and raisins. Whisk to combine. Add the butter cubes to the dry mixture and toss to coat. Use a pastry cutter to cut the butter into small pea-sized pieces. Add the raisins to the dry mixture and toss to coat. Add the wet to the dry and stir until just combined. Then knead a few times in the bowl until it comes together. Line a 13 x 18-inch half-sheet pan with parchment paper. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and form it into a 7 1/2-inch circle. Cut the circle into 8 triangles with a bench scraper. Refrigerate (or freeze) the dough for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) convection. If your oven doesn’t have a convection setting, preheat to 425°F (220°C). Brush the scones with more buttermilk, sprinkle with sugar. Bake for 10 minutes. Turn the oven down to 375°F (190°C) and bake for 10 to 12 minutes more until golden brown.",
