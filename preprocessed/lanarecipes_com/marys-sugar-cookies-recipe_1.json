    "instructions": "Cream the softened butter and sifted confectioners' sugar in a large bowl until wonderfully smooth and fluffy. Beat in the large egg, then stir in the vanilla extract and almond extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and cream of tartar. Gradually blend this dry mixture into the creamed ingredients until a soft dough forms. Do not overmix. Cover the dough tightly and refrigerate for at least two hours. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). On a lightly floured surface, roll out each portion of chilled dough to about 3/16 inch thick. Cut out shapes using cookie cutters. Carefully place the cut-out cookies about 1 1/2 inches apart onto greased cookie sheets. Sprinkle the tops of the cookies with granulated sugar. Bake for about 8 minutes, or until the edges are just lightly browned. They should be tender, not crisp. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.",
