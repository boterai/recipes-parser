    "instructions": "On the work surface or in a bowl, place the flour. Add the eggs, olive oil, water, salt and mix with a fork. When the flour has absorbed the mixture, work the dough by hand for about 3 to 4 minutes until it is compact, smooth and elastic (add water if it is dry or flour if it is too sticky). Form a ball and let rest for 30 minutes. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough. In a bowl, using a hand blender, mix the mortadella, ricotta, parmesan, egg, nutmeg and sage until smooth. Season to taste. On the work surface, arrange the ravioli dough strips. On the lower half of each strip, place a spoonful of stuffing at regular intervals (about 2”). Fold each upper part of the pasta strips over the lower part (where the stuffing is) to form the ravioli. Crush the dough between each ravioli, pressing firmly, then cut out the outline of each ravioli with a knife, a cookie cutter, a pastry wheel, in the shape of squares, circles or triangles as desired. Bring a saucepan of salted water (coarse salt) to the boil and cook the ravioli in boiling water for about 3 minutes. Then drain. In a hot pan, brown the mushrooms in 60 ml (4 tbsp) of olive oil for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the veal stock, half of the garlic and reduce to 2/3. In a bowl, using a hand blender, puree the basil, parsley, honey and remaining olive oil. Check the seasoning. When ready to serve, add the mushrooms to the herb mixture, mix, serve alongside the ravioli, green onions and grated parmesan.",
