    "notes": "In Mumbai, at a restaurant called Monties, I ate the most spectacular version of Akuri (Parsi eggs) that featured ground/minced lamb. I've made these at home using this recipe, only adding about 1/2 cup ground lamb at the same stage as the onion/ginger and cooking for 4-5 minutes... I then follow the recipe to finish the eggs. It's a super splendid variation of Parsi eggs.",
