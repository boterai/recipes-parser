You can thin out the sauce out further if you need to here, by adding more cashew nut cooking liquid - I like mine rich and creamy, but sometimes it gets a little thick - you decide!Remove from the heat and that's it.

    "notes": "Add some heat to your curry by incorporating a spicier chili powder into the sauce or throwing in some fresh green chilies with the cashews. The level of spiciness is entirely up to you! For an authentic touch, consider adding green peas, spinach, fresh or frozen fenugreek leaves, potatoes, chickpeas, or other vegetables and pulses to your Kaju Maluwa. Experiment with different combinations to achieve a variety of flavors and textures. Just be sure to adjust the cooking time accordingly and possibly add more liquid if needed. Serving and storing suggestions Cashew Curry stores well in the freezer - keep in airtight containers for up to 3 months. Cook from frozen until hot. In the fridge I'll be good for 4-5 days, sealed in an airtight container.",
