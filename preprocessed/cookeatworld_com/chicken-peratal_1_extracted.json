    "notes": "Because this dish is enjoyed in South India and Malaysia, the ingredients can vary widely to incorporate local ingredients. It's not uncommon to find lemongrass and pandan leaves in the Malay version along with some recipes that use coconut milk/cream, both commonly found in Southern Indian and Malaysian cuisine. You can store in the fridge for up to a week (well covered), or in the freezer for 3+ months. Reheat until piping hot. If you're reheating from frozen add a little water about (1/4 cup) to help avoid the sauce drying out too much. Serve with basmati or jasmine rice or Indian breads or flaky Malaysian roti.",
