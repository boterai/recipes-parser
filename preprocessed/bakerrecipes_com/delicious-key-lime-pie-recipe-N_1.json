Stir the egg yolk mixture into the gelatin mixture. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, just until the mixture comes to a boil. Remove from heat; stir in grated peel. Chill, stirring occasionally, until the mixture mounds slightly when dropped from a spoon. Beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually, add the remaining sugar, beating until stiff.
