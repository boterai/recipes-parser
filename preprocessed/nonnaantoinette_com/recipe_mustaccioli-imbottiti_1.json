    "instructions": "Sift flour and cocoa powder into a large bowl. Add almond flour and sugar. Stir with a spoon. Add allspice, salt, baking powder, orange zest and stir. Now add the liquids and continue to stir. Turn mixture onto a lightly floured surface and knead by hand until a soft dough is formed. Dough should not be sticky nor should it be so dry that it won’t come together. Please adjust recipe as needed with more water if too dry or more flour if too sticky. Shape dough into a ball and wrap with film. Rest dough in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, gather your favorite fillings and line baking sheets with parchment paper. Preheat oven to 365F. Place rested dough onto a lightly floured surface. Cut in half. Roll the first half into a rectangle about a 1/4” thick. Cut strips about 3” wide. Now make diagonal cuts so that you are left with diamond-shaped pieces of dough. Place one dough diamond onto the prepared baking sheet. Place a generous teaspoon of your favorite filling in the center. Moisten the seams and place a second diamond onto top. Seal seams well by pressing with fingertips. Continue until all dough is used, including the trimmings. Bake in preheated oven for 12-13 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to totally cool. Melt your favorite chocolate flavor in microwave or on a double boiler. Cover each cooled mustacciolo with chocolate on both sides. Allow chocolate to dry before serving. Store in a sealed container in a cool, dry place.",
