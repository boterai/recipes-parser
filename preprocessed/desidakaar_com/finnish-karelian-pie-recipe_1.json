    "instructions": "1. Bring water to a boil. Add rice and butter. Continue to cook until liquid has been consumed, then add the milk. 2. Let it simmer for about 35-40 minutes until porridge is finished. Do not forget to stir; otherwise, at the bottom, the porridge will burn. 3. Add salt to the water and add 50 g of flour. Add the butter. 4. Knead to a soft dough after. 5. Split the dough into four pieces and roll each piece into a stick. Keep covering the remainder of the mixture as you work on each part. 6. Divide the dough stick into 4-5 parts and roll into a thin disk on a floured surface. The crust is intended to be thick, as this makes it crisp, but it goes pretty straightforward on the flour. The thinner and drier the dough, the more probable the crust at the crimping point will be to break. 7. A helpful tip for a beginner is to roll the dough into a thin sheet and then cut the sheet to the same size with either a cookie cutter or a tiny bowl (about 12 cm in diameter). 8. On the disks, spoon the porridge (about 2 tbsp per pastry), fold the corners on top, and crimp. This is done with relatively light fingers, as the plates are not supposed to be too sharp. 9. Depending on the stove 250-275 ° C (482-527 ° F), they need a warm oven. Place the pastries on a baking tray. Because in the dough, there is no yeast or baking powder, these will not grow during baking, so there is no need to leave room between them. 10. Remove from the oven and brush with melted butter once the pastries get a touch of color. Let it cool while it is coated. 11. Boil the eggs in freezing water and cool. 12. Mash with butter, using a fork, while still a little hot. Season with chives and salt and serve with pastries.",
