Mix the ingredients together, adding more water as necessary to make a soft dough. Knead for about 7 to 10 minutes, until it's smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let it rise for 1 to 2 hours. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased surface and gently deflate it. Divide it into pieces and roll each piece into a 12\" round. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Brush each crust with olive oil, spread sauce, and add toppings.
