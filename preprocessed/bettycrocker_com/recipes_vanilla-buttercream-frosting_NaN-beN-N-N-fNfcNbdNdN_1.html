Let the butter sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes before mixing to get the right consistency.</p><p><strong>Lumpy Powdered Sugar:</strong> Powdered sugar can clump, especially if it’s been sitting in the pantry for a while. To remove lumps, place powdered sugar in a fine-mesh sieve and sift it into the bowl or onto waxed paper.</p><p><strong>Too Much Powdered Sugar:</strong> Accurate measurements are key. Spoon the powdered sugar into your measuring cup and level it off with a table knife for the correct amount.</p><p><strong>Undermixing:</strong> If the frosting hasn’t been whipped long enough, it can end up a bit clumpy. We found through our testing that mixing for a few extra minutes until it’s light, smooth, and fluffy will fix this.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I add food coloring to this buttercream frosting?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Yes, you can absolutely add food coloring to this buttercream frosting!

                        <h2>Recipe Ingredients</h2>
    <p></p><p><strong>Unsalted Butter:</strong> Butter is the star of this frosting, so be sure to use high-quality real butter. If you're using salted butter, simply omit the salt.</p><p><strong>Powdered Sugar:</strong> Also known as confectioners' sugar, this ingredient gives the frosting its light, fluffy texture. If your sugar has been sitting around for a while, just shake it through a fine mesh strainer to get rid of any lumps.</p><p><strong>Vanilla:</strong> The heart of this homemade buttercream frosting. For the best flavor, we recommend using pure vanilla extract over imitation vanilla.</p><p><strong>Milk:</strong> We tested this recipe with whole milk, but you can use any milk you have on hand—or even heavy cream.</p><p>Salt: Just a pinch of salt will balance the sweetness and enhance the flavor of the buttercream frosting.</p><p></p>

    <h2>Cookware You’ll Need</h2>
    <p></p><p><strong>Electric Mixer:</strong> An electric hand mixer makes the mixing process quicker and much easier. A stand mixer works as well—just keep an eye on it, as it is more powerful. Use the beaters for the hand mixer or the paddle attachment for the stand mixer. If you don’t have either, a mixing spoon or rubber spatula will work just fine.</p><p><strong>Other Cookware You'll Need:</strong> Mixing bowl, dry measuring cups, measuring spoons, spatula.</p><p><strong>Cake and Cupcake Decorating Tools You’ll Need:</strong> Offset spatula, decorating bags, piping tips.</p><p></p>
    <h2>How to Make Buttercream Frosting</h2>
    <p></p><p>Here’s how to make this easy buttercream frosting recipe:</p><h3>1. Mix Butter and Powdered Sugar</h3><p><a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/how-to/ingredients-and-preparation/how-to-soften-butter">Softened butter</a> is key to a light, fluffy frosting. To measure the powdered sugar, spoon it into a dry measuring cup and level off. Using a hand mixer on low speed, blend until the butter and sugar are combined. Then, beat on high until light and fluffy.</p><h3>2. Add in Milk and Vanilla</h3><p>With the mixer on low speed, add the vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon of milk. Always start with the smallest amount of milk, as it’s easier to add more if needed. Our pro tip: Don’t forget to scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters to avoid lumps in your frosting.</p><h3>3. Mix Until Fluffy</h3><p>Beat on low until the mixture is fluffy and creamy. Check the consistency by spreading a bit of frosting on the side of the bowl—it should be smooth and spreadable.</p><p></p>
    <h2>Possible Variations</h2>
    <p></p><p>Extracts like peppermint, coconut, maple, or spices like cinnamon can easily be stirred in for a change in flavor. For a fresh twist, brighten it up with citrus zest or juice. If you're a coffee fan, mix in espresso powder, or try adding dulce de leche or salted caramel for richness.</p><p>Once you've perfected the classic, take it to the next level. Swap the butter for peanut butter to make creamy peanut butter frosting. Or try one of our favorites from the Betty Crocker Test Kitchens—<a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/marshmallow-buttercream-frosting/544b55b2-da64-4117-95ef-bc267d94976c">Marshmallow Buttercream</a>, which adds extra sweetness with marshmallow crème. For something indulgent, make <a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/chocolate-buttercream-frosting/c530f4f8-2182-4b89-8938-34a25ff8134a">Chocolate Buttercream</a> by adding melted chocolate for a rich, velvety flavor.</p><p></p>
    <h2>Ways to Use Buttercream Frosting</h2>
    <p></p><p>This buttercream frosting recipe will frost your favorite 13x9-inch cake or an 8- or 9-inch two-layer cake. It can also frost about 24 cupcakes (our <a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/chocolate-cupcakes/f15e69fc-7b15-4845-9fa6-52f3afd6fa08">Chocolate Cupcakes</a> are a great pairing). If you want a thick layer of frosting or are aiming for bakery-style, heavily frosted cupcakes, this is the perfect recipe!</p><p>Beyond frosting cakes and cupcakes, this frosting is ideal for filling cupcakes, topping brownies, piping into cream puffs, or using in sandwich cookies. It pairs wonderfully with chocolate, vanilla, lemon, strawberry, and spiced cakes like carrot or pumpkin. Just be mindful when pairing it with very rich or sweet cakes, as this frosting adds sweetness. A good rule of thumb: use heavier frostings (like this buttercream) with richer cakes, and lighter frostings (like icings) with lighter cakes.</p><p></p>
    <h2>Storing The Frosting</h2>
    <p></p><p>If you make this vanilla buttercream frosting ahead of time or have any leftovers, it’s easy to store for later use.</p><h3><strong>Refrigerator</strong></h3><p>Store frosting in a food storage container and press plastic wrap directly against the surface to prevent a crust from forming, then seal tightly with a lid. Store in the fridge for up to 5 days.</p><h3><strong>Freezer</strong></h3><p>Pack up frosting as you would for storing in the refrigerator but wrap the entire container with foil before placing in the freezer. Store in the freezer for up to 1 month.</p><h3><strong>How to Thaw</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>From the Refrigerator: </strong>Let the frosting container sit at room for 30 minutes to soften. Stir well or whip with a hand mixer before using.</li><li><strong>From the Freezer: </strong>Remove the frosting container from the freezer the day before. Remove the foil and let it thaw in the refrigerator overnight. Once thawed, let it sit on the counter for 30 minutes, then whip before using.</li></ul><p>While microwaving buttercream is possible, we don't recommend it. Microwaving can change the texture and cause the frosting to become runny very quickly.</p><p></p>

                How can I make the frosting less sweet?
             <span class="toggleButton"></span></button></h3></div> <div aria-hidden="true" class="accordionContent"><p></p><p>Buttercream frosting is naturally sweet thanks to powdered sugar; however, if you prefer a less sweet frosting, try these simple adjustments:</p><p><strong>Reduce Powdered Sugar:</strong> Cut back by 1/4 to 1/2 cup. You may need to cut back on the milk to keep the frosting spreadable.</p><p><strong>Add Lemon Juice:</strong> Swap 1/4 to 1 teaspoon of the milk for lemon juice, as the acidity helps balance the sugariness.</p><p>Keep mixing the buttercream and taste as you go, adjusting until it’s just the right sweetness for you.</p><p></p></div></div> <div class="accordionContainer"><div class="accordionHeadingContainer"><h3><button type="button" aria-expanded="false" class="accordionButton">
                Why is my frosting grainy or clumpy?
             <span class="toggleButton"></span></button></h3></div> <div aria-hidden="true" class="accordionContent"><p></p><p>There are a few common culprits behind a clumpy texture, but don’t worry—here’s what to watch out for to get a smooth frosting.</p><p><strong>Using Butter That is Too Cold:</strong> If the butter isn’t softened properly, it won’t blend well with the powdered sugar, causing clumps. Let the butter sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes before mixing to get the right consistency.</p><p><strong>Lumpy Powdered Sugar:</strong> Powdered sugar can clump, especially if it’s been sitting in the pantry for a while. To remove lumps, place powdered sugar in a fine-mesh sieve and sift it into the bowl or onto waxed paper.</p><p><strong>Too Much Powdered Sugar:</strong> Accurate measurements are key. Spoon the powdered sugar into your measuring cup and level it off with a table knife for the correct amount.</p><p><strong>Undermixing:</strong> If the frosting hasn’t been whipped long enough, it can end up a bit clumpy. We found through our testing that mixing for a few extra minutes until it’s light, smooth, and fluffy will fix this.</p><p></p></div></div> <div class="accordionContainer"><div class="accordionHeadingContainer"><h3><button type="button" aria-expanded="false" class="accordionButton">

             <span class="toggleButton"></span></button></h3></div> <div aria-hidden="true" class="accordionContent"><p></p><p>Yes, you can absolutely add food coloring to this buttercream frosting! After years of decorating cakes, we've found that gel or paste food colors work best. Gel and paste food colors are concentrated and thicker, so you only need a small amount to achieve dark, vibrant colors.</p><p></p></div></div></div>
