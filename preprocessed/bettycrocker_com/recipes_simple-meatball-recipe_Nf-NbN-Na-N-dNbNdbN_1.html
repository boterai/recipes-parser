make, it’s no wonder they’ve become a tried-and-true dinner tradition for so many families. While this classic recipe calls for lean beef, seasoned bread crumbs, milk, Worcestershire sauce, onion and egg, and is simply delicious as is, it’s also easily customizable. Substitute other ground meats for the beef like turkey or chicken. Instead of baking, simmer them on the stovetop in a pot of marinara sauce. And while spaghetti noodles are the most classic presentation, they’re also delicious served over rice, alongside steamed vegetables, or in a hearty meatball sub sandwich. Add in a fresh side salad and Neapolitan ice cream or gelato for dessert, and you have a homemade Italian feast!","contentUrl":"https://www.bettycrocker.com/videos/easy-meatballs","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ixqteos-Fdg","uploadDate":"2023-08-25T00:00:00.00-06:00"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Edited by Angela Ritchie"},"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"<p>Heat oven to 400°F.

                        <h2>Recipe Ingredients</h2>
    <p></p><p>Our simple meatball recipe comes together with the help of just a handful of key ingredients.</p><p><strong>Ground Beef:</strong> You’ll want at least 80% lean ground beef. After years of testing, we’ve found this percentage of lean meat to fat gives you the juiciest, most tender meatballs.</p><p><strong>Italian-Style Breadcrumbs:</strong> Bread crumbs act as a binder, helping to hold the meatballs together while they cook. We like the Italian-style, especially when we’re making an Italian meatball recipe to serve alongside pasta. We’ve tested them with plain bread crumbs too, though, which are perfect if you plan to use these baked meatballs in a BBQ or Asian-inspired sauce.</p><p><strong>Milk:</strong> This dairy product moistens the meatball mixture while bringing just a little creaminess. We typically use whole or 2% milk for this recipe but any type will work.</p><p><strong>Egg:</strong> A single egg adds moisture and richness to the meatball mixture and helps to bind the meatballs together while they cook.</p><p><strong>Onion:</strong> Finely chopped onion adds even more flavor and texture to the recipe.</p><p><strong>Worcestershire Sauce:</strong> Savory and slightly tangy, this condiment adds loads of umami flavor.</p><p></p>
    <h2>Cookware You’ll Need</h2>
    <p></p><p><strong>Rimmed Baking Pan</strong>: You’ll want a baking pan with sides for this recipe, to keep any excess juices from spilling over.</p><p><strong>Aluminum Foil</strong>: Use aluminum foil, which we like to coat with cooking spray, for easy release and faster clean up.</p><p><strong>Instant-Read Meat Thermometer</strong>: After years of testing other methods, we’ve found that using an instant-read thermometer is the best way to tell when your meatballs are done.</p><p><strong>Other Cookware You’ll Need: </strong>Mixing bowl, mixing spoon, dry measuring cups and measuring spoons.</p><p></p>
    <h2>How to Make Meatballs</h2>
    <p></p><p>Here’s a preview of how to make our easy and versatile recipe.</p><h3><strong>1.&nbsp;Mix Ingredients</strong></h3><p>In a large bowl, combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, milk, salt, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, finely chopped onion, and egg. Use a large spoon to mix all the ingredients until just combined. Overmixing the ingredients can make the meatballs tough.</p><h3><strong>2.&nbsp;Shape Meatballs</strong></h3><p>Lightly wet hands with water before shaping meatballs to help prevent the meat mixture from sticking to your hands. Use your wet hands to shape the meat mixture into 24 (1 1/2-inch) meatballs and place them 1 inch apart on a foil-lined pan. Spray the pan with cooking spray beforehand to prevent sticking.</p><h3><strong>3. Bake Meatballs</strong></h3><p>All that’s left to do is bake your meatballs in a 400°F oven for 18 to 22 minutes or until the temperature on an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a meatball reaches 160°F and the centers are no longer pink.</p><h3><strong>4. Serve Meatballs</strong></h3><p>Whether they’re slathered in your favorite teriyaki or barbecue sauce or sitting on top of a pile of spaghetti, there is no end to the ways you can enjoy these versatile meatballs.</p><p></p>
    <h2>Possible Variations</h2>
    <p></p><p>We know our deliciously simple meatball recipe is a great place to start when it comes to creating variations.</p><p>While we’ve given you some of our favorites below, we’ve also been listening to you! Renee74 says, “I took the advice of others and added parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning and garlic powder and it was delicious! &nbsp;This was so easy and a new favorite of mine. &nbsp;Will be making them again.”</p><p><strong>Use Turkey or Chicken:</strong> Feel free to switch it up with different ground meats like chicken or turkey. To make the substitution, go ahead and swap 1 lb lean ground turkey or chicken for the ground beef. If using ground chicken, decrease milk to 2 tablespoons. Bake until a thermometer inserted in center reads 165°F.

Slather them in your favorite BBQ sauce or try our<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/asian-meatballs-with-teriyaki-glaze/37bca95b-5468-4232-9f93-324f0bde6db8"><strong>Asian Meatballs with Teriyaki Glaze</strong></a> or our spicy-sweet <a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/cranberry-glazed-appetizer-meatballs/045e049b-ad24-4980-b5a0-83f11a7bcdea"><strong>Cranberry-Glazed Appetizer Meatballs</strong></a>.</p><p></p>

    <h2>Storing and Reheating Meatballs</h2>
    <p></p><p>Here’s our favorite way to store and reheat meatballs.</p><h3><strong>Refrigerator Storage</strong></h3><p>Place baked meatballs in an airtight food storage container and store in the fridge. Your baked meatballs will last in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p><h3><strong>Freezer Storage</strong></h3><p>To freeze baked meatballs, place cooked and cooled meatballs on an ungreased cookie sheet. Freeze, uncovered, for about 20 minutes or until firm. Transfer partially frozen meatballs to a heavy plastic freezer bag or freezer-safe container and place in the freezer. Your meatballs will last in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p><h3><strong>Reheating Baked Meatballs</strong></h3><p><strong>• Refrigerated Meatballs</strong>: Remove the baked meatballs from the fridge. Place them in a baking dish and cover with aluminum foil. Bake in a 350°F oven for 10 to 15 minutes or until heated through. Make sure they reach an internal temperature of 160°F to ensure they’re thoroughly reheated and safe to eat.</p><p><strong>• Frozen Meatballs</strong>: Bake them as directed for refrigerated meatballs, add 3 to 5 minutes to the baking time.&nbsp;</p><p></p>
    <h2>Why Betty Users Love This Recipe</h2>

To do this, we use ground meat with 20% fat. Extra lean ground meat can result in a dense, dry meatball. We also use just enough bread crumbs to absorb the milk in the recipe and hold the liquid inside the meatball as it cooks.</p><p></p></div></div> <div class="accordionContainer"><div class="accordionHeadingContainer"><h3><button type="button" aria-expanded="false" class="accordionButton">

They work to hold the meatballs together and help them retain their moisture in the cooking process. After years of testing and perfecting this recipe, we think we have found that our ultra-moist and juicy simple meatballs hold together beautifully.</p><p></p></div></div></div>
