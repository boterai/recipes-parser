    "instructions": "1. In large bowl, beat 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, the softened butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla, the almond extract, and egg with electric hand mixer (or stand mixer with paddle attachment) on medium speed, or mix with a spoon or rubber spatula, until all the ingredients are smooth and thoroughly blended. 2. Stir in flour, baking soda, and cream of tartar just until combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough cookies. 3. Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a 1-inch-thick flattened disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours. The dough is ready when it feels firm to the touch and no longer sticky. 4. Heat oven to 375°F. 5. Roll disks, one at a time, on a lightly floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness. Be careful not to use too much flour, as it can make the cookies tough. Cut with 2- to 2 1/2-inch cookie cutters into desired shapes, placing the cuts close together on the rolled-out dough to reduce scraps and limit rerolling. Place cutouts at least 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets. 6. Place cookie sheet on the middle oven rack. Bake 7 to 8 minutes or until edges are light brown. Cool 1 minute; remove from cookie sheets to cooling racks. Cool completely, about 30 minutes. 7. In medium bowl, beat 3 cups powdered sugar, 4 tablespoons milk, and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla with spoon until smooth and spreadable. If icing is too stiff to spread, add additional milk, 1 teaspoon at a time. Tint with food color as desired. 8. Holding the cookie in one hand, use an off-set metal spatula or a butter knife to spread the frosting over the top of each cookie. You can stop when you’re about 1/4-inch from the edge. Decorate as desired with colored sugar or candy sprinkles. Let stand about 4 hours or until icing is set. 9. Store covered in airtight container at room temperature with waxed paper between layers.",
