    "instructions": "Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add your diced onion and minced garlic, stirring occasionally until they’re translucent and smell absolutely incredible—about 5-6 minutes. Don’t rush this flavor-building step; this is where the magic starts! Add your diced potatoes to the pot and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. This gives them a head start and helps them absorb flavors better. Here’s my plant-based secret: add your curry powder, turmeric, cumin, and paprika directly to the pot with the potatoes. Stir everything together for about a minute, toasting those spices with the potatoes and aromatics. This blooms their flavors and creates incredible aromatic depth. The kitchen will smell like pure comfort food heaven. Pour in your coconut milk and vegetable broth, stirring to combine everything beautifully. Season generously with salt and pepper—plant-based cooking needs bold flavors to really shine. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Reduce the heat to low and let your curry simmer gently for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are fork-tender and the sauce has thickened slightly. Don’t worry if you’re new to plant-based cooking—just let it bubble away gently and the potatoes will become perfectly creamy while absorbing all those gorgeous spices. Taste and adjust your seasonings. I usually add more salt or a squeeze of lime juice for brightness. Trust your palate! Serve your gorgeous curry over fluffy cooked rice and garnish with fresh cilantro if you can resist diving in immediately. Every spoonful should have that perfect balance of creamy sauce, tender potatoes, and aromatic spices!",

    "notes": "Don’t skip toasting the spices with the potatoes—this 1-minute step creates incredible depth of flavor that makes this taste like it’s been simmering for hours. Use full-fat canned coconut milk, not the carton stuff. The canned version creates that rich, creamy sauce this curry needs. This tastes even better the next day after the potatoes have absorbed all those flavors. Make it ahead for easy weeknight dinners. The curry will thicken as it sits because potatoes absorb liquid. Just add a splash of coconut milk or broth when reheating.",
