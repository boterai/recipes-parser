    "instructions": "Preheat oven to 200°C using 4D Hot Air mode. Place potatoes on a tray. Pierce with fork, and season with salt to taste. Bake for about 50 minutes to 1 hour. Check with skewer to ensure they are fully cooked and soft. Leave aside to cool for about 10 to 15 minutes. Skin cooked potatoes. Pass through ricer into a bowl. Make a crater in the centre. Add eggs, nutmeg, white pepper, and salt. Knead for about 5 to 10 minutes to combine. Sieve 200g of the flour into a bowl, and add to potato mix. Continue kneading to form dough, and divide into four pieces. Lightly dust worktop surface with some of the remaining flour. Roll each piece into a string with 2cm thickness. Cut strings into 1cm long nuggets, and use the tip of a fork to make markings. Place and space nuggets on lined baking tray to prevent clumping. Fill a pot with water. Season with salt to taste and bring to boil. Cook Gnocchi for about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove once soft. Cut cherry tomatoes into halves. Roughly chop 15g parsley, and set 5g aside for garnishing. Blend garlic, shallots and anchovies to form paste with your Hand Blender. In a lightly heated sauté pan, melt butter. Fry blended paste. Add capers, lemon juice, halved cherry tomatoes, and cook until soft. Season with salt and pepper. Add cooked gnocchi, and toss with sauce. Drizzle olive oil, add chopped parsley, and mix well. Remove from heat. Top with grated parmesan and chopped parsley. Serve and enjoy.",
