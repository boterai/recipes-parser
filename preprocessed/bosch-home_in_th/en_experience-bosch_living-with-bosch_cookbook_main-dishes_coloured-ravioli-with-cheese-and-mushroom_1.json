    "instructions": "1. Peel and cut carrots. Separately puree cut carrots and spinach with 50ml of water each. 2. Strain purees for carrot juice and spinach juice respectively. 3. In a clean bowl, add all eggs and yolks. Beat well to combine. Separate into 2 equal portions. 4. Attach the Kneading Hook to your Kitchen Machine. Into the Mixing Bowl, add 1 portion of the egg mixture and a pinch of salt. Mix on Speed 3. 5. Gradually add 250g of double zero flour, then carrot juice. Ensure that texture of dough is not too wet or sticky. If the dough is too dry, adjust consistency with more juice. 6. When a crumbly texture is formed, increase to Speed 4 for 3 to 5 minutes until juice is absorbed, and an orange-coloured dough is achieved. 7. Remove dough and knead until combined into a ball. When a smooth surface is achieved, wrap in cling film. 8. Repeat the same process with the other half of the egg mixture and double zero flour, salt and spinach juice to prepare the green-coloured dough. Chill both pieces of dough in fridge for 2 hours. 9. Chop white button mushrooms into quarters. Finely chop fresh basil leaves. Deseed and slice green and red chillies. 10. Finely chop shallots, then garlic, with your Hand Blender. 11. In a pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Add quartered mushrooms and thyme. Fry until softened. 12. Add 2 tablespoons of chopped shallots and 1 tablespoon of chopped garlic. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add water and fry until cooked. 13. Roughly blend cooked mushrooms, ricotta cheese, salt and pepper to taste with your Hand Blender. 14. Remove doughs from fridge. Attach Pasta Press to your Kitchen Machine. Start thickness setting at 8 and pass the orange dough through the press. Adjust thickness setting to 6 and pass it through again. 15. Repeat with decreasing thickness settings until 0. 16. Dust with plain flour to prevent sticking. Fold pasta sheet into half and then half again. Repeat pasta pressing cycle from thickness setting 8 to 0 once again until even. 17. Cut 2 uniform sheets from the orange pasta sheet. Dust table top with plain flour. Brush one sheet with water. Lightly mark out filling areas with small ring mould, with sufficient space in between. 18. Pipe filling. Brush water over other sheet. Lay over first sheet and seal filling tightly. 19. Cut out ravioli with bigger ring mould. Pierce ravioli with a skewer to prevent them from bursting. Dust ravioli with flour to prevent sticking. 20. Repeat the entire pasta pressing, filling, sealing, cutting and piercing process with the green dough. 21. Bring a pot of water to boil. Add a pinch of salt. Boil ravioli for about 3 to 5 minutes. 22. In a lightly heated non-stick pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Fry the remaining chopped garlic and shallots, and sliced red and green chillies. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons of water from the cooking pasta to form emulsion. 23. When the ravioli are cooked, remove them from the water. Toss cooked ravioli with chopped basil leaves in the emulsion. 24. Garnish with extra virgin olive oil, grated parmesan cheese and chopped parsley. Season with more salt and pepper if needed.
