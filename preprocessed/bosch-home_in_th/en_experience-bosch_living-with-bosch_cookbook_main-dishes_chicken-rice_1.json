    "instructions": "Remove excess fats from the cleaned chicken (giblets removed) for cooking rice later. Stuff the chicken with pandan leaf and spring onion stalks and seal it with skewers. Submerge chicken in a boiling pot of water and cook it for 30 – 35 minutes. After it’s cooked, set aside 200ml of poaching liquid for preparing sauces later. Submerge the chicken in a large bowl of iced water for 10 minutes to retain the tenderness of the meat. When the chicken is completely cooled, rub it with sesame oil and cover it with cling film to prevent it from drying out. Blend garlic, ginger and shallots into a paste using the MaxoMixx handblender. Cut off the bottom of the stem of the lemongrass stalks, before smashing them. Sauté excess chicken fats in vegetable oil and add the blended paste and lemongrass stalks. Fry for 5 minutes, until the mixture turns fragrant and brown. Set aside 1 tablespoon of the mixture for soy and sesame sauce. In the same pan, add in jasmine rice, chicken stock and pandan leaves and stir fry for 2 minutes. Cook the rice in the oven using Steam mode for 30 minutes. Deseed chilli padi and fresh red chillies. Cut fresh red chillies into pieces. Blend garlic, fresh red chillies, chilli padi, lime juice, chicken poaching liquid, ginger, salt and sugar until mixture becomes smooth. Blend fried paste, light soya sauce, chicken poaching liquid, sesame oil and oyster sauce until mixture becomes smooth. Blend ginger, garlic, chicken poaching liquid, sesame oil, white pepper powder and salt until a paste is formed. Slice Japanese cucumber thinly. Slice spring onion thinly and chop coriander roughly before soaking them in iced water. Cut and break down chicken. Garnish with spring onion and coriander and serve with steamed rice and sauces.",
