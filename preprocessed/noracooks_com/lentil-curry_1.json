    "instructions": "Heat the olive oil in a large deep skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the turmeric, cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper and salt and cook for 30-60 seconds, stirring constantly so it doesn't burn. Add a few tablespoons of water if needed. Pour in the water, scraping any bits stuck to the pan. Add the lentils and crushed tomatoes and mix well. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer, cover and cook for 30-40 minutes (if using red lentils, it will only take 25-30 minutes), until the lentils are soft and cooked. Stir occasionally. Once the lentils are cooked, stir in the coconut milk and lemon juice. Taste; add more salt as desired. Remove from heat and stir in the cilantro. Serve with rice, naan and garnish with more fresh cilantro, if desired.",

    "notes": "Use jarred chopped garlic and a tube of ginger if you want to make it easier and quick, but fresh will taste best. This is a great freezer recipe, cool in freezer friendly containers and freeze.",
