    "instructions": "1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-inch pie plate with cooking spray. In a food processor, process graham crackers until finely ground. Add butter and 1 tablespoon of water, and process until the crumb clumps together. Press crumb mixture into bottom of pie plate and about 1/2-inch up the sides. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes, then let cool. 2. In a small bowl, dissolve the gelatin in 3 tablespoons of boiling water. Let it sit for 1 minute. 3. In a medium saucepan, whisk together 1/3 cup of sugar and the flour. Cook over a medium heat, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes, until the mixture comes to a boil and has thickened. 4. In a medium bowl lightly beat the milk and eggs together. Add the egg and milk mixture to the saucepan and whisk so the flour and sugar dissolve. Cook over a medium heat, stirring constantly, for 10 minutes, until the mixture comes to a boil and has thickened. 5. Stir in the vanilla extract and gelatin. Set aside to cool slightly. 6. Arrange the sliced bananas on the graham cracker crust and pour the pudding on top. Place in the refrigerator until the pudding has set, about 3 hours. 7. Whip the cream with an electric beater. When it is about halfway done, add 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, then continue whipping until fully whipped. 8. Put the whipped cream in a plastic bag, concentrating it in 1 corner of the bag. Snip that corner off the bag and squeeze the whipped cream out of the bag in a decorative pattern around the pie.",

    "notes": "To ensure the crust is flaky, make sure to press the crumb mixture into the pie plate firmly and evenly. When making the filling, don’t overcook the mixture, as it can become too thick and sticky. To achieve the perfect whipped cream, make sure to whip the cream until it’s stiff and holds its shape.",
