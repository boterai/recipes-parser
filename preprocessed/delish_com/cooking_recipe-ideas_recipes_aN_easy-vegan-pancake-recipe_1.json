In a large skillet over medium low heat, heat oil. Using a 1/4 cup measure, pour batter into pan. Cook 2 to 3 minutes, and flip when you see bubbles forming around the edges of the pancakes. Cook 2 to 3 minutes more on the opposite side, until golden. (If making a large batch, preheat oven to 200° and place prepared pancakes on baking sheet in oven.) 3. When all batter has been used, serve with maple syrup and toppings of your choice.",
