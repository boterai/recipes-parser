    "instructions": "In bowl of stand mixer fitted with a paddle, beat the cool butter until creamy. Add the salt (if using) and powdered sugar and beat until light. Beat in the vanilla and almond extract. Scrape sides of bowl, beat a little more, than lower speed of mixer and beat in the egg. Scrape sides of bowl. With mixer on medium low, add the baking soda and cream of tartar. By hand or using lowest speed of mixer, gradually add the flour. Remove dough from pan and divide into two big balls. At this point, I like to roll or press each ball out onto a sheet of non-stick foil or parchment. Press to a thickness of around ¼ inch. Lay dough flat on a cookie sheet and chill the flattened dough until it's firm enough to cut. You can cut it with cutters or just use a round glass. Alternatively, you can roll the dough out on a floured board and cut with cutters. The extra flour that the dough picks up from the board will help them hold their shape better. Arrange cut cookies on a foil or parchment lined cookie sheet and bake at 375 for 10 minutes or until edges are nicely browned. Makes about 2 dozen depending on how big you cut your cookies. For frosting, beat the butter until creamy. Gradually add the about half of the confectioners' sugar, beating and scraping bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of the milk and the vanilla, then beat, scraping bowl. Add remaining confectioners sugar gradually, then remaining milk. Adjusting milk as needed for a creamy consistency. Add a few pinches of salt to taste. For Easy Creamy Frosting, sift the powdered sugar and just add liquid to it gradually, stirring until smooth and creamy and the consistency you like. Stir in the flavoring. You can also divide it up and color it.",
