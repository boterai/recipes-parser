    "instructions": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Beat the shortening and butter until creamy, then add both sugars and beat with an electric mixer until light and creamy. Add the egg and beat until it is blended in, then beat in the vanilla. Add the salt and baking soda and beat until thoroughly mixed, then add the flour and stir until blended. Stir in the chocolate chips. Using a medium size cookie scoop, scoop out balls of cookie dough. Bake immediately or arrange on a foil lined dinner plate, cover with plastic wrap and chill overnight. To bake the cookies, arrange 2 ½ inches apart on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake at 375 for 10-12 minutes (time will vary depending on size of cookie and how cold the dough is). Let cool on baking sheet for about 5 minutes, then carefully transfer to a wire rack.",
