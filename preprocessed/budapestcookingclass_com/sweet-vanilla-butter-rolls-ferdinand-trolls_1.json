    "instructions": "Heat the milk until lukewarm, mix in the sugar and the fresh yeast. Let it sit for 10 minutes. Sift the flour in a bowl. Add a pinch of salt, 3 egg yolks, 2 tablespoons of room temperature butter and the milk with the sugar and yeast. Knead until the dough starts to hold together, if it is sticky, add more flour. Keep kneading until smooth and well combined. Oil a bowl, place the dough in, oil the dough too, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a lukewarm place for 50-60 minutes. Melt 1 stick of butter and mix it with 5 tablespoons of sugar and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract. Preheat the oven to 355 F (180 °C). Place the dough onto an oily surface. Brush the rolling pin with some oil too. Roll out the dough into a 0.2 inch thick rectangle. Spread the 2/3 of the butter-sugar mixture onto the dough, beginning at a short end roll it up. Cut into 1.5 inch wide pieces. Thoroughly butter a rondeau pan and place the rolls into the pan, let the rolls sit for another 15 minutes. Pour the rest of the butter-sugar mixture on the rolls and bake them for about 25 minutes. In a saucepan, heat 2/3 cup of whipping cream with 2 tablespoons of sugar and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract. Do not boil, just make it very hot. After 25 minutes of baking pour over the rolls with the hot cream combined with sugar and vanilla, and bake for another 5–10 minutes or until golden brown. For the vanilla sauce: In a medium saucepan heat 2 cups of milk. In a medium bowl, separate egg yolks from whites. You need only the yolks. With an electric hand-mixer or whisk beat the egg yolks with the sugar and the corn starch until thick and creamy. Temper the egg mixture, pour some of the hot milk into the egg yolks, mix well. Now pour this mixture back to the rest of the milk, put back on the heat, keep stirring. Do not let it boil, this prevents the eggs from scrambling. Keep stirring until you get a creamy consistency. Turn the heat off and keep stirring for another minute. Add the vanilla extract. Serve the baked rolls with this vanilla sauce.",
