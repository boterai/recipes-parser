In a large bowl, whisk together melted butter, granulated and brown sugars, eggs, and vanilla until smooth. Stir in mashed bananas until fully combined. In a separate bowl, mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon (if using). Fold dry ingredients into banana mixture just until combined. Do not overmix. Pour batter into prepared pan and bake for 30–40 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Let cake cool completely before frosting. For frosting, beat cream cheese and butter until creamy. Gradually add powdered sugar and lemon juice/zest until smooth. Spread frosting over cooled cake. Chill slightly to set before slicing and serving.",
