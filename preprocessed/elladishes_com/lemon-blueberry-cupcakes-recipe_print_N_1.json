    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with cupcake liners. In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. In another bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Stir in the lemon zest and lemon juice. Alternate adding the dry ingredients and milk into the batter, mixing gently until combined. Fold in the blueberries carefully to avoid bursting them. Divide the batter evenly among the liners, filling about two-thirds full. Bake for 18–22 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Let cool completely before topping with cream cheese frosting or a lemon glaze.",
