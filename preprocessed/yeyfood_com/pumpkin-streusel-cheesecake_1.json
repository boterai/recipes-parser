    "instructions": "Make the crust: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and sugar. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake for 10 minutes, then let cool completely. Make the filling: In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add the granulated sugar, cornstarch, pumpkin puree, sour cream, pumpkin pie spice, and vanilla extract, beating until well combined. Add the eggs and egg yolks, one at a time, beating just until incorporated. Prepare the streusel: In a small bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and salt. Cut in the cold butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Assemble and bake: Pour the filling into the prepared crust. Sprinkle the streusel evenly over the top. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the cheesecake is set around the edges but slightly jiggly in the center. Cool and serve: Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside with the door slightly ajar for 1 hour to cool. Transfer the cheesecake to the refrigerator and chill for at least 4 hours before serving. Serve with whipped cream or a drizzle of caramel sauce.",

    "notes": "Don’t overbake the cheesecake. The cheesecake is done when the edges are set but the center still jiggles slightly. Overbaking can cause the cheesecake to crack. Let the cheesecake cool completely before refrigerating. This will help prevent the cheesecake from cracking. Serve the cheesecake chilled. Chilling the cheesecake will help it hold its shape and prevent it from becoming too soft.",
