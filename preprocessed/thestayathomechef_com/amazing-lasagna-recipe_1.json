    "instructions": "In a large pot over medium heat, add in ground sausage and ground beef. Use a spoon to break up the meat into small pieces. Add in onion and garlic and cook until meat is well browned, stirring constantly. Stir in sugar, fresh basil, fennel, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup chopped parsley. Pour in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and wine. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer 1-4 hours, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into the bottom of a 9x13 pan. Pour hot tap water directly over the noodles, making sure the pasta is completely immersed in the water. Let them soak for 30 minutes, then drain and discard water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg. Refrigerate until ready to assemble lasagna. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a deep dish 9x13 or lasagna pan. To assemble, spread about 1 cup of meat sauce in the prepared lasagna pan, just enough to cover the bottom. Place 4 lasagna sheets on top. Spread with 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture on top of the pasta. Top with 1/4 of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, then sprinkle with 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Repeat layering two more times with pasta, ricotta, mozzarella, meat sauce, then parmesan cheese, creating three complete layers. To finish, place a final layer of pasta sheets. Then spread 1 cup of meat sauce to cover the pasta and keep it from drying out. Top with remaining mozzarella slices and the remaining parmesan cheese. Cover the pan loosely with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes to allow cheese to brown. Serve hot.",

    "notes": "White wine can be replaced with red wine, chicken broth, or beef broth. The sauce develops flavor as it simmers. It needs to be simmered for a minimum of 1 hour (uncovered) to give you an amazing lasagna, but you can simmer it up to 4 hours for the most amazing lasagna. If simmering longer than 1 hour, add a lid after 60 to 90 minutes to prevent too much evaporation.",
