    "instructions": "Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. To make the Bolognese sauce, start by adding ground sweet Italian sausage and ground beef to a large pot over medium heat. Use a spoon to break up the meat into small pieces. Once the meat begins to brown, add white onion and minced garlic, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until the onion is soft and the meat is well browned. Pour in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and chicken broth. Stir in granulated sugar, chopped fresh basil, fennel seeds, dried oregano, salt, black pepper, and chopped fresh parsley. Stir to combine, then bring the sauce to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and allow the sauce to simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. While the sauce simmers, prepare the zucchini. Cut zucchini lengthwise into 1/8-inch thick strips. Place the strips into a large colander and sprinkle them generously with salt to help draw out excess moisture. Let the zucchini sit for 10 minutes, then rinse the strips with water and pat them dry using paper towels. In a separate bowl, prepare the ricotta layer by combining ricotta cheese with large egg, chopped fresh parsley, salt, and ground nutmeg. Stir until the mixture is smooth, then refrigerate until ready to assemble the lasagna. To assemble the lasagna, spread 1 cup of the Bolognese sauce on the bottom of the prepared dish. Layer some of the zucchini strips over the sauce to cover the bottom. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture evenly over the zucchini, followed by 1/4 of the shredded mozzarella. Spoon 1 1/2 cups of the Bolognese sauce over the mozzarella, then sprinkle with 1/4 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Repeat this layering process two more times, ending with a final layer of zucchini topped with 1 cup of the Bolognese sauce. Finish by sprinkling the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top. Cover the baking dish loosely with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 50 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbling and browned. For the last 10 minutes of baking, remove the foil to allow the top to brown further. Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.",

    "notes": "Zucchini has a lot of water in it, and salting it will help take that moisture out. Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Freeze leftover portions in an airtight container or resealable plastic freezer bag. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight. Reheat portions in the microwave on high in 30-second increments.",
