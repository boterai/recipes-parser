    "instructions": "Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Add ground Italian sausage and cook, breaking it into small pieces, until browned, about 8–10 minutes. Drain excess grease, then return the pot to medium-high heat. Add the diced onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5–7 minutes. Stir in minced garlic and cook for 1–2 minutes, until fragrant. Stir in beef broth, tomato sauce, and diced tomatoes. Add Italian seasoning, black pepper, and bay leaves. Stir to combine. Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a simmer. Once simmering, reduce the heat to medium-low and let the soup simmer gently for 15–20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Break lasagna pasta into bite-size pieces, stir them into the soup and cook for an additional 12–15 minutes, or until the noodles are tender but still slightly firm to the bite (al dente). Remove the pot from the heat and discard the bay leaves. While the noodles cook, prepare the cheese topping. In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, and Italian seasoning. Mix until well combined. To serve, ladle the soup into bowls and top each serving with a generous spoonful of the cheese mixture. Serve immediately and enjoy!",
