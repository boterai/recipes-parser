    "instructions": "Heat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and place liners in the cupcake pan to keep things mess-free. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a roomy bowl, whisking until everything is evenly mixed. Cream the softened butter and sugar together with an electric mixer for around 3 minutes. The goal is to get it light and fluffy, which will give your cupcakes that perfect, tender texture. Crack in the eggs one by one, blending each until just combined. Then, stir in the lemon zest and fresh lemon juice, followed by the vanilla extract to add extra flavor depth. Gently combine the dry ingredients with the wet mixture, adding the buttermilk in between. Be sure not to overmix. After the batter is finished, delicately stir in the blueberries. Fill each cupcake liner with batter, making sure they’re about three-quarters full. It helps the cupcakes rise gracefully while keeping them from overflowing. Bake the cupcakes for 18-22 minutes. The cupcakes are finished when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out without batter. While they cool, prepare the frosting. Beat the softened butter and cream cheese until they’re airy and well-blended. Gradually add powdered sugar, starting with three cups, adjusting for the desired thickness, add more for a firmer frosting or a bit of milk for a softer texture. Incorporate the lemon zest, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and a touch of salt to achieve the ideal flavor harmony. When the cupcakes are completely cooled, go ahead and frost them! You can pipe or spread the frosting generously over each one. For a lovely finishing touch, garnish with fresh blueberries and a sprinkle of lemon zest. Enjoy your freshly baked Lemon Blueberry Cupcakes!",

    "notes": "Let the cupcakes cool completely before frosting. When baking, check them with a toothpick, don’t rely solely on time. For an even moister cupcake, consider using sour cream in place of buttermilk. If you’re using frozen blueberries, don’t thaw them, they’ll hold their shape better.",
