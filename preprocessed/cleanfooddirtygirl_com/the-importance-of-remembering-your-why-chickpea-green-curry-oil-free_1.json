    "instructions": "Place all of the Green Curry Sauce ingredients into your blender and blend until completely smooth. Set aside for now. Heat a large pot over medium heat for about 2 minutes. Add the sliced onion and saute for about 5 minutes, stirring often and adding a small splash of water if they begin to stick. Add the Green Curry Sauce, chickpeas, and green beans to the pot and stir. Bring to a simmer, then cover the pot with a lid and gently simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the bell pepper, cabbage, and kale to the pot and cook with the lid on for an additional 10 minutes, or until the green beans are crisp tender or as soft as you like them. While your Curry is simmering, place the water and arrowroot flour in a small bowl and whisk until well combined. When the Curry is done simmering, add the water / arrowroot mixture and stir for 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in the basil and lime juice. We suggest serving over rice topped with chopped cashews, green onion, jalapeno, and sesame seeds. Squeeze some fresh lime juice over the top and dig in!",
