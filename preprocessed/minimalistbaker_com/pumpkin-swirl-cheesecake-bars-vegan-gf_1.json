    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350 F (176 C) and line an 8×8-inch baking dish with parchment paper. Add oats, almonds, salt, coconut sugar, and pumpkin pie spice to a high-speed blender and blend on high until the mixture resembles a fine meal. Add the lesser amount of coconut oil to the blender and pulse or blend until well combined. Transfer the mixture to the lined dish and spread evenly. Bake for 20-25 minutes. While the crust is cooling, rinse your blender and make your cheesecake batter. Add raw cashews, coconut cream, vegan cream cheese, arrowroot or cornstarch, maple syrup, 1/2 cup pumpkin purée, 1 tsp pumpkin spice blend, salt, and vanilla to the blender. Blend on high until smooth. Set aside 1/2 cup of the cheesecake batter, then pour the remaining batter on top of the crust. To the empty blender, add the reserved batter, remaining pumpkin purée, and remaining pumpkin pie spice. Blend until smooth. Tap the dish to remove air bubbles, dollop the darker pumpkin cheesecake mixture on top, and swirl. Bake for 50-60 minutes. Cool and refrigerate for 6-8 hours or overnight. Cut into squares and serve.",
