    "instructions": "Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line an 8 x 8-inch baking pan with parchment paper. To a medium mixing bowl, add the cane sugar and softened vegan butter. Using an electric mixer, beat on medium/high speed until light and fluffy. Next, add the pumpkin purée and vanilla extract and beat until pale orange and fluffy. Add the gluten-free (or all-purpose) flour, almond flour, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, and sea salt and mix until fully incorporated. The batter will be very thick — somewhere between cake batter and cookie dough. Spread half the batter on the bottom of your parchment-lined baking pan and sprinkle the top with brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice (to make the SWIRL). Spread the remaining batter on top of the pumpkin pie spice and sugar, scraping the bowl clean. To the same (now empty) mixing bowl, add the gluten-free (or all-purpose) flour blend, vegan butter, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, and salt and mix on low speed until fully combined. It should look crumbly. Sprinkle the crumble topping evenly over the top of the coffee cake. Bake for 38-42 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean // with only a few crumbs remaining. Let cool in the pan for 15 minutes before removing and cooling on a cooling rack for another 15 minutes. Enjoy warm or at room temperature.",
