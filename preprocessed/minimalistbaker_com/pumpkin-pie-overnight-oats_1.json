    "instructions": "To a small bowl add almond milk, pumpkin purée, almond butter, chia seeds, maple syrup, pumpkin pie spice, and vanilla and stir with a spoon to combine. Add oats and stir a few more times. Get two small mason jars or small bowls with lids, and divide the oats equally between them. Then press the oats down with a spoon to ensure all oats have been moistened and are immersed in liquid. Cover securely with lids or seal and set in the refrigerator overnight (or for at least 6 hours) to set/soak. Add roughly chopped pecans to a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat and toast them, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes. Turn the heat down to low, add the maple syrup, and mix quickly to evenly coat the pecans. Spread them out so they are not in any large clumps, then add the pumpkin pie spice and mix once more. Remove from heat and let cool completely. Store in an airtight container. The next day, open your oats and top with the candied pecans and coconut yogurt. Enjoy!",
