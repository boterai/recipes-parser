    "instructions": "1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with festive liners. In a large bowl, whisk sugar, oil, eggs, and extracts until smooth. Stir in sour cream. In a separate bowl, sift flour, baking powder, and salt. Fill liners ⅔ full. Bake 14–16 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean. Let cool completely. 2. Beat cold butter until fluffy (~5 mins). Gradually add powdered sugar, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Split frosting into four parts: Green: 90% of the batch (tint with electric green + a dab of yellow). Red, Black, White: Small portions for details. 3. Fit a piping bag with a Wilton 233 grass tip. Starting at the base, pipe upward strokes to create wild, grassy hair. Use a round tip (Wilton 1A) to pipe a red swirl on top. Add a white pompom and trim with white frosting. Press halved yellow M&Ms for eyes. Pipe black pupils and eyebrows.",
