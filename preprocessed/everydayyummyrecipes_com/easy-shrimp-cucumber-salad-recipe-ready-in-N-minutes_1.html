For this recipe, our bright lemon vinaigrette keeps everything crisp!</p></div></div><div id="faq-question-1745102796439" class="rank-math-list-item"><h3 class="rank-math-question "><strong>Is cucumber safe for shrimp?</strong></h3><div class="rank-math-answer "><p>Absolutely! Cucumbers and shrimp pair perfectly. Just ensure shrimp is properly cooked (or thawed if using pre-cooked) and pat cucumbers dry to prevent watery salad.</p></div></div><div id="faq-question-1745102811707" class="rank-math-list-item"><h3 class="rank-math-question "><strong>What are the ingredients in shrimp salad?</strong></h3><div class="rank-math-answer "><p>Our 15-minute version uses cooked shrimp, crisp cucumbers, red onion, fresh herbs, and a zesty lemon-honey dressing. Optional add-ins: avocado, cherry tomatoes, or feta.</p></div></div><div id="faq-question-1745102842267" class="rank-math-list-item"><h3 class="rank-math-question "><strong>What dressing goes on cucumber salad?</strong></h3><div class="rank-math-answer "><p>&nbsp;Light vinaigrettes (lemon, olive oil, herbs) work best. Creamy dressings like ranch can be used but add just before serving to maintain crunch.</p></div></div><div id="faq-question-1745102852855" class="rank-math-list-item"><h3 class="rank-math-question "><strong>Why you must not eat raw cucumber with meals?</strong></h3><div class="rank-math-answer "><p>This is a myth! Raw cucumbers are hydrating and nutritious. However, those with sensitive digestion may peel them to reduce fiber. Our recipe keeps skins on for extra nutrients.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="recipe"></div><div id="wprm-recipe-container-1410" class="wprm-recipe-container" data-recipe-id="1410" data-servings="4"><div class="wprm-recipe wprm-recipe-template-chic wprm-min-400 wprm-max-500 wprm-max-600 wprm-max-700 wprm-max-800 wprm-max-900"><div class="wprm-container-float-right"><div class="wprm-recipe-image wprm-block-image-rounded"><img data-lazyloaded="1" data-placeholder-resp="250x250" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIyNTAiIGhlaWdodD0iMjUwIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjUwIDI1MCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgc3R5bGU9ImZpbGw6I2NmZDRkYjtmaWxsLW9wYWNpdHk6IDAuMTsiLz48L3N2Zz4=" loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;border-color: #666666;border-radius: 3px;" width="250" height="250" data-src="https://everydayyummyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shrimp-Cucumber-Salad-4-300x300.webp" class="attachment-250x250 size-250x250" alt="Fresh shrimp cucumber salad with lemon dressing in a white bowl." data-srcset="https://everydayyummyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shrimp-Cucumber-Salad-4-300x300.webp 300w, https://everydayyummyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shrimp-Cucumber-Salad-4-150x150.webp 150w, https://everydayyummyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shrimp-Cucumber-Salad-4-768x768.webp 768w, https://everydayyummyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shrimp-Cucumber-Salad-4-500x500.webp 500w, https://everydayyummyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shrimp-Cucumber-Salad-4.webp 1024w" data-sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt="" data-jpibfi-post-url="https://everydayyummyrecipes.com/easy-shrimp-cucumber-salad-recipe-ready-in-15-minutes/" data-jpibfi-post-title="Easy Shrimp Cucumber Salad Recipe – Ready in 15 Minutes!" data-jpibfi-src="https://everydayyummyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shrimp-Cucumber-Salad-4-300x300.webp"></div></div><h2 class="wprm-recipe-name wprm-block-text-bold">Easy Shrimp Cucumber Salad – Ready in 15 Minutes!</h2><div class="wprm-spacer"></div>
