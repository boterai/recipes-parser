    "instructions": "1. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Add the beeswax pearls (or honey) and stir until melted. Brush the inside of the cannelé moulds with the syrup. 2. Heat the milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until steaming. Add the vanilla bean and butter. 3. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, and nutmeg. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, rum, vanilla extract, lemon zest, cheese, ham, and black pepper. Gradually add the milk mixture to the dry ingredients, whisking until smooth. Finally, add in the egg mixture and whisk until combined. 4. Cover the batter and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. 5. Preheat the oven to 210°C (410°F).
