    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F). If your canelé moulds are new, grease them with butter and place them in the oven for 30 minutes. Remove them from the oven and let them cool completely. To make the syrup, melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Add the beeswax pearls and stir until they are melted. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Brush the inside of the canelé moulds with the syrup. Place the moulds upside down on a wire rack covered with paper towels and let cool to allow the excess syrup to drain. To make the cannelés, heat the milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until it is hot. Add the vanilla bean and butter and let cook for a few minutes. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, and cardamom. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, rum, vanilla extract, lemon zest, and orange blossom water. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined. Cover the batter and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight. Remove the vanilla bean from the batter. Fill the canelé moulds 2/3 full with batter. Bake the cannelés for 15-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Let the cannelés cool for a few minutes before serving.",
