    "instructions": "Begin by pouring the milk into a saucepan along with the rum, chocolate, and semi-salted butter. Heat the mixture over low heat, ensuring it doesn’t boil, just long enough to melt the butter and chocolate. While the milk mixture is heating, place the 170g of whole egg and the 2 egg yolks in a bowl along with the sugar. Mix gently with a whisk until just combined. Add the flour to the egg mixture and stir until smooth. Slowly pour the heated milk mixture into the bowl with the eggs and flour, stirring constantly to combine all the ingredients thoroughly. Transfer the combined mixture into a container. Allow it to cool to room temperature, then cover it with cling film and refrigerate overnight. The next day, remove the container from the refrigerator at least 3 hours before making the canelés. Give the mixture one final gentle mix. Grease the copper molds with butter or use a non-stick baking spray to ensure easy release of the canelés. Preheat your oven to 275°C. If your oven’s maximum temperature is 250°C, ensure it reaches at least that temperature. Once the oven is fully preheated, bake the canelés for 10 minutes at 275°C or 13 minutes at 250°C. Then, lower the oven temperature to 180°C and continue baking for an additional 35 minutes.",

Ensure that the milk mixture is heated gently over low heat to melt the chocolate and butter without boiling. Don’t rush the resting period in the refrigerator. Properly grease the copper molds with butter or use a non-stick baking spray to ensure easy release of the canelés after baking. Make sure your oven is fully preheated to the specified temperature before baking the canelés.",
