    "instructions": "1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a 12-inch pizza pan or baking sheet to prevent sticking. 2. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the refrigerated biscuit dough to fit the pizza pan. Press the dough firmly into the pan, covering the bottom and slightly up the sides to form a sturdy crust base. 3. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the crumbled breakfast sausage until it is browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside, leaving the drippings in the pan. 4. To the same skillet, add the diced onion and minced garlic; sauté for 2-3 minutes until the onion softens. Sprinkle the all-purpose flour over the mixture and cook for an additional minute, stirring constantly to form a roux. Gradually whisk in the milk and continue cooking until the gravy thickens, about 2-3 minutes. Stir the cooked sausage back into the gravy and season with salt and pepper to taste. 5. Spread the prepared sausage gravy evenly over the biscuit dough crust. Evenly sprinkle the shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheeses over the gravy. Carefully crack the two large eggs on top of the pizza, spacing them evenly to allow for cooking. 6. Place the assembled pizza into the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes. Bake until the biscuit crust turns golden brown, the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the eggs are cooked but still slightly runny in the center. 7. Remove the pizza from the oven and allow it to cool for a few minutes. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley before slicing and serving warm.",

    "notes": "You can use store-bought or homemade sausage gravy for convenience. For firmer eggs, bake for an additional few minutes, or for runnier yolks, reduce baking time slightly. Make sure to grease the pan well to prevent the biscuit crust from sticking. Feel free to substitute cheese varieties to customize the flavor. Leftovers can be refrigerated and gently reheated in an oven or skillet.",
