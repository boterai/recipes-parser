    "step_by_step": "1. Make the chili paste: In a small bowl, mix the chili powder, chipotle chili powder, ground cumin, oregano, thyme, and ground coriander seeds. Mix in water so that chili forms a light paste. Set aside. 2. Cook the bacon: Cook the bacon in a large skillet on medium high heat until crisp. Use a slotted spoon to remove from pan and set aside on a paper towel. Pour bacon fat from the pan into a separate container, reserve. When the bacon cools, crumble it into smaller pieces and set aside. 3. Brown the beef chunks in bacon fat: Increase heat to medium high, add back in 1 tablespoon of bacon fat. Working in batches so that you don't crowd the beef, brown the beef cubes on all sides, lightly salting as you cook the beef. Remove beef from pan, set aside. 4. Cook the onions: Add another tablespoon of bacon fat to the pan. Add the chopped onions and sauté until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and jalapeño, cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add the chili paste and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes. 5. Combine the chili ingredients in a big pot, simmer, then cook slowly: Into a 6-quart, thick-bottomed Dutch oven, put onion-chili mixture, beef, bacon, tomatoes, water, lime juice, and sugar. Heat the chili on medium high heat until it comes to a simmer. Then reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 1 1/2 hours. Then uncover and cook for another half hour. 6. Thicken with cornstarch: Mix the cornstarch powder into a little water to dissolve the cornstarch and add to the chili to thicken it. 7. Add the kidney beans: Gently mix in the kidney beans. Add salt to taste. Adjust seasonings. 8. Add toppings to serve: Sprinkle with grated cheddar cheese and chopped red onion. Serve with cornbread, tortilla chips, and/or rice.",
