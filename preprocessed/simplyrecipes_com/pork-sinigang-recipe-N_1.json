    "step_by_step": "[\"Trim off the hard fat cap on top of the pork belly slab and discard, leaving enough of the softer fat layer on top for the pork pieces to be flavorful and turn tender while cooking. Cut the pork belly and pork shoulder into 2-inch cubes. Set aside.\", \"In a large stockpot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the tomatoes, onions, and garlic and sauté until soft, about 5 minutes.\", \"Add the fish sauce and stir to incorporate into the vegetables. Add the pork and cook until the meat is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.\", \"Pour the water and diluted tamarind soup mix into the stockpot. Bring to a simmer, then cover the pot with a lid and simmer over low heat until the pork is tender, 40 to 45 minutes.\", \"While the broth is simmering, prep the vegetables: Peel the daikon radish and slice it thin. Trim the ends from the beans and cut them into 2-inch pieces. Slice the eggplant on the bias into bite-sized pieces, 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick. Separate the leaves from the stems of the water spinach, then slice the stems into 2-inch pieces.\", \"When the pork is tender, add the Daikon radish and cook over low heat until it is soft and just turning opaque, about 5 minutes. Add the green beans and cook till they are just tender and vibrant green, about 5 minutes. Add the eggplant and cook until it begins to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the stalks of the water spinach and cook until soft, about 5 minutes, followed by the spinach leaves, cooking until they wilt, about 2 minutes.\", \"Add the whole chile, salt, and pepper. Simmer the stew until the flavors meld, about 5 minutes more.\", \"If you prefer a less spicy sinigang, remove the chile before serving. Serve the sinigang warm with steamed rice and more fish sauce on the side for dipping.\"]",
