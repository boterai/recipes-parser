    "ingredients": "[{\"name\": \"all-purpose flour\", \"units\": \"cups\", \"amount\": \"5 ½ to 6\"}, {\"name\": \"granulated sugar\", \"units\": \"tablespoons\", \"amount\": \"3\"}, {\"name\": \"Fleischmann’s® RapidRise® Yeast\", \"units\": \"(14g)\", \"amount\": \"2 packets\"}, {\"name\": \"salt\", \"units\": \"teaspoons\", \"amount\": \"2\"}, {\"name\": \"water\", \"units\": \"cups\", \"amount\": \"1 ½\"}, {\"name\": \"milk\", \"units\": \"cup\", \"amount\": \"½\"}, {\"name\": \"butter\", \"units\": \"tablespoons\", \"amount\": \"2\"}]",
    "instructions": "1. Combine Dry Ingredients: In a stand mixer bowl, mix 2 cups of flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Stir until combined. 2. Prepare Liquid Mixture: Heat water, milk, and butter in the microwave. Use 15-second bursts on high until the mixture is warm (120° to 130°F). The butter won’t fully melt—that’s okay. 3. Mix and Knead the Dough: Add the warm liquid to the dry ingredients and beat at medium speed for 2 minutes, scraping the bowl as needed. Add 1 more cup of flour and beat on high speed for another 2 minutes. Gradually stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough ball. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for 6 to 8 minutes until it’s smooth and elastic. 4. Rest and Shape: Cover the dough with a towel and let it rest for 10 minutes. Divide the dough into two equal pieces. Roll each into a 12 x 7-inch rectangle. Starting at the short end, roll the dough tightly and pinch the seams to seal. Tuck the ends under. 5. Let it Rise: Place the rolled dough, seam-side down, into two 8 ½ x 4 ½-inch loaf pans sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Cover with a towel and let the dough rise in a warm spot until doubled in size (about 45 minutes). 6. Bake: Preheat your oven to 400°F. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes until the loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped. Remove from pans and cool on a wire rack.",

    "notes": "Warm Environment for Rising: Place dough in a slightly warm oven (turn it on for 1 minute, then off) to help it rise faster. Alternatively, you can place it near a sunny window or on top of a warm appliance for a natural rise. Testing for Doneness: Use a food thermometer to check if the bread’s internal temperature has reached 190°F. Storage: Wrap cooled bread in plastic wrap or a sealed bag. Store at room temperature for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 2 months.",
