    "instructions": "Preheat oven to 400°F and grease a baking sheet. In a small bowl, mix milk and vinegar. Let sit for 8–10 minutes until slightly curdled. In a large bowl, stir together flour, sugar, salt, and baking soda. Pour the milk mixture into the dry ingredients and stir gently until a shaggy dough forms. Turn dough onto a floured surface and lightly knead just until it comes together. Shape into a round loaf and place on the prepared baking sheet. Cut a deep X into the top of the dough using a floured knife. Bake for 30–40 minutes until golden and hollow-sounding when tapped. Cool slightly before slicing and serving.",
