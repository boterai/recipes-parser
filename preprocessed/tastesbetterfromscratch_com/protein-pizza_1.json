Place a piece of parchment paper on the counter and dust lightly with flour. Using well-floured hands, scoop dough onto parchment and roll into a 14-inch circle, dusting the top with flour to keep it from sticking. Transfer the dough to a pizza stone or large baking sheet and pre-bake dough for 8 minutes. Remove from oven then add sauce and toppings. Bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and crust is golden.",
