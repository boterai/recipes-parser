    "instructions": "Season beef with salt and pepper toss with flour to fully coat. Heat a Dutch oven over medium high heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil. Brown beef on all sides, working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pot. Remove beef from pan and transfer to slow cooker. Return pot to heat, add another tablespoon oil. Add onions, season with salt and sauté until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat as needed to avoid burning onions. When onions are golden, add tomato paste and garlic, stir until combined and a 'fond' has begun to develop on the bottom of the pot. Slowly whisk in beef bouillon, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Add ½ cup Guinness, brown sugar and fresh thyme. Whisk to combine. Add potatoes and carrots to slow cooker. Pour broth over meat and vegetables. Set slow cooker to low and cook for 6-8 hours. If broth is not desired consistency, see notes for how to thicken it. When finished cooking, stir in remaining ¾ cup Guinness and fresh chopped parsley. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed. Serve.",

    "notes": "The flour used on the beef should thicken the stew, but if it is not as thick as you would like, make a slurry. To make a slurry, add two tablespoons of flour to a small bowl. Pour in ¼ cup warm broth from the pot. Whisk until smooth and no lumps remain. Pour the slurry into the stew and stir to fully combine. Cook for 20-30 minutes, the stew will thicken as it continues to cook.",
