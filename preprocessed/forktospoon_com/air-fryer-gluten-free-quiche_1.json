    "instructions": "Combine melted butter, egg, almond flour, and salt in a mixing bowl. Stir until the mixture forms a dough-like consistency. Place the dough over a large piece of parchment paper so it’s easier to lift. Use a rolling pin to extend it until it’s ⅓ inch thick. Spray your tart pan with non-stick cooking spray or brush with olive oil. Transfer the dough over the prepared tart pan and cover the base and sides. Place the tart pan with the crust in your Air Fryer. Air fry at 320 degrees F (160°C) for about 5 minutes or until the crust becomes slightly golden. Remove and set aside. To make the filling, sauté the onion with two tablespoons of olive oil. Stir until the onion is translucent. Then, add minced garlic and stir until fragrant. Remove from heat. Beat the eggs in a large bowl; add salt, pepper, feta cheese, cherry tomatoes, chopped spinach, and sautéed onion. Stir to combine. Transfer the filling to the quiche base and extend evenly. Top with shredded cheddar cheese. Place the filled tart pan back into the Air Fryer. Air fry at 330 degrees F (165°C) for 15-20 minutes or until the quiche is set and the top is golden brown. Serve warm with fresh salad on the side.",
