    "ingredients": "[{\"name\": \"pie crust\", \"units\": \"crust\", \"amount\": \"1/3\"}, {\"name\": \"dried wild mushrooms\", \"units\": \"pieces\", \"amount\": \"2-3\"}, {\"name\": \"hot water\", \"units\": \"cup\", \"amount\": \"1\"}, {\"name\": \"grated smoked gouda cheese\", \"units\": \"cup\", \"amount\": \"1/8\"}, {\"name\": \"large egg\", \"units\": \"piece\", \"amount\": \"1\"}, {\"name\": \"heavy cream\", \"units\": \"tablespoon\", \"amount\": \"1\"}, {\"name\": \"kosher salt\", \"units\": \"teaspoon\", \"amount\": \"1/4\"}, {\"name\": \"black pepper\", \"units\": \"teaspoon\", \"amount\": \"1/4\"}]",
    "instructions": "Remove refrigerated pie crust from the refrigerator for about 15 minutes before preparing quiche. Place wild mushrooms in a small bowl. Pour hot water over the wild mushrooms and set aside for 10-15 minutes to allow them to rehydrate. When mushrooms are soft and moist, drain water and pat them dry. Chop into small pieces. Unroll pie crust dough and place your tart pan on top of the crust. Cut a circle (it doesn’t have to be perfect) about 1 inch outside the border of the tart pan. Press the crust into the tart pan, tucking the edges down along the sides and cutting off any excess dough so that the crust is even with the top of the pan. Place the tart pan into the air fryer's basket and cook at 300°F for 5 minutes. Sprinkle grated gouda into the bottom of the cooked crust and top with chopped mushrooms (1-2 tablespoons). Whisk together egg and heavy cream until smooth and fluffy. Carefully pour the egg mixture over the cheese in the crust. The egg mixture should reach the top edge of the crust. Do not overfill. Top with a pinch of salt and pepper. Place the prepared quiche back into the air fryer's basket and cook at 300°F for another 10 minutes or until the egg is set in the center. Allow to cool for 1-2 minutes, and then carefully pop the quiche from the tart pan. Use a spatula to remove the quiche from the bottom plate of the tart pan and serve immediately or set it on a cooling rack to cool.",

    "notes": "If you have access to fresh wild mushrooms, there is no need to rehydrate them – rinse, chop, and you’re ready to go. You may be able to fit two quiches into the air fryer at once. Adjust the amount of heavy cream you add if you need a bit more filling.",
