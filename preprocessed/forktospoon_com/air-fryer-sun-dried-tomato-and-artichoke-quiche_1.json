    "ingredients": "[{\"name\": \"Pie Crust\", \"units\": \"6-inch round\", \"amount\": \"1\"}, {\"name\": \"Monterey Jack Cheese\", \"units\": \"cup\", \"amount\": \"1/8\"}, {\"name\": \"Artichoke Hearts\", \"units\": \"cup\", \"amount\": \"1/8\"}, {\"name\": \"Sun-Dried Tomatoes\", \"units\": \"pieces\", \"amount\": \"3-4\"}, {\"name\": \"Egg\", \"units\": \"large\", \"amount\": \"1\"}, {\"name\": \"Heavy Cream\", \"units\": \"tablespoon\", \"amount\": \"1\"}, {\"name\": \"Salt\", \"units\": \"teaspoon\", \"amount\": \"1\"}, {\"name\": \"Black Pepper\", \"units\": \"teaspoon\", \"amount\": \"1/2\"}]",
    "instructions": "Remove the refrigerated pie crust from the refrigerator about 15 minutes prior to preparing the quiche. Unroll the dough and place your tart pan on top of the crust. Cut a circle (doesn’t have to be perfect) about 1 inch outside the border of the tart pan. Press the crust into the tart pan, tucking the edges down along the sides and cutting off any excess dough so that the crust is even with the top of the pan. Place the tart pan into the basket of the air fryer and cook at 300°F for 5 minutes. Sprinkle cheese into the bottom of the tart pan and then distribute artichoke heart pieces and sun-dried tomato pieces over the top of the cheese. Whisk together egg and heavy cream until smooth. Take a moment to whisk some extra air into the egg mixture. Carefully pour the egg mixture over the fillings in the crust. The egg mixture should reach the top edge of the crust. Do not overfill. Place the prepared quiche back into the basket of the air fryer and cook at 300°F for another 10 minutes or until the egg is set in the center. Allow to cool for 1-2 minutes and then carefully pop the quiche from the tart pan. Use a spatula to remove the quiche from the bottom plate of the tart pan and serve immediately or set it on a cooling rack to cool.",

    "notes": "You may be able to fit two quiches into the air fryer at once. Test out the space before filing the tart pans. Cooking two at once did not affect the cooking time in my air fryer but adjust accordingly. You could also use swiss, gruyere cheese or even mozzarella would be nice.",
