    "instructions": "Start by placing the chicken breasts in the bottom of your slow cooker. Then add pineapple chunks, diced bell pepper, and chopped onion evenly on top of the chicken. In a separate bowl, whisk together pineapple juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, minced garlic, dried thyme or Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper flakes if using, and salt and pepper until nicely combined. Pour the sauce mixture over the chicken and vegetables. Cover the crockpot and cook on low for 6 to 7 hours, or high for 3 to 4 hours, until the chicken is fully cooked and tender. About 30 minutes before serving, mix cornstarch with water until smooth, then stir this into the crockpot to thicken the sauce. Cover again and continue cooking for those last 30 minutes. When the chicken is tender and the sauce has thickened, you can shred the chicken slightly using two forks if you like. Serve the chicken and sauce over cooked white rice and garnish with sliced green onions for a fresh finish.",
