    "instructions": "1. In a bowl or jar, add the rolled oats, milk, pumpkin puree, chia seeds, maple syrup, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Stir everything together until well combined, making sure all the oats are coated. 2. Cover your bowl or jar with a lid or plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator. Let the mixture soak for at least 4 hours, or overnight, so the oats absorb the liquids and become creamy. 3. In the morning, give the oats a good stir. If it feels too thick, add a splash of milk and stir again. Spoon the oats into your serving bowls or glasses. Top with a dollop of whipped cream, sprinkle chopped nuts on top, and finish with a light dusting of cinnamon. Enjoy your delicious pumpkin pie-flavored breakfast!",
