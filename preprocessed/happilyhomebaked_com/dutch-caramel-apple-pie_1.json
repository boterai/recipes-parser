    "instructions": "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and sugar. Add the cold butter cubes, and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to mix until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces. Slowly add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough holds together when pressed. Shape it into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for at least 1 hour. Set your oven to 375°F (190°C) and let it warm up while you finish the next steps. In a large bowl, toss the sliced apples with granulated sugar, brown sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and vanilla extract until everything is well mixed and the apples are nicely coated. On a floured surface, roll out your chilled dough into a 12-inch circle. Carefully transfer it to a 9-inch pie dish, pressing gently along the bottom and sides. Trim any dough that hangs over the edges. Mix together the flour, brown sugar, rolled oats, cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl. Cut the cold butter into the mixture with a pastry cutter or your fingers until it looks crumbly. Pour the apple filling evenly into the crust. Then, sprinkle the crumb topping over the apples to cover fully. Place the pie on a baking sheet to catch any drips. Bake for 50-60 minutes, until the topping is golden and filling bubbly. If it browns too fast, cover loosely with foil. Let the pie cool for at least 2 hours to set. Before serving, drizzle warm caramel sauce over each slice and top with vanilla ice cream for an extra special treat.",
