    "instructions": "1. Preheat your oven broiler and line a baking sheet with foil. Toast the 4 slices of crusty bread until lightly golden, then spread each with the tablespoon of Dijon mustard (add the teaspoon of whole grain mustard if you like texture). 2. Wipe and slice about 12 oz mushrooms and pat them dry with paper towels so they brown better. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the 2 tablespoons unsalted butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil. 3. Add the mushrooms in a single layer, don’t crowd them, and let them sit 2 to 3 minutes so they get a nice brown color. Stir and keep cooking until most of the liquid evaporates and mushrooms are caramelized. 4. Lower heat to medium, add the 2 cloves minced garlic, 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme (or 1/2 teaspoon dried), 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Cook about 30 to 60 seconds until fragrant but not burned. 5. Stir in 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce and 1 teaspoon lemon juice if using, then fold in the mustards so the mushrooms are coated. Taste and adjust salt or pepper. 6. Pile the mushroom mixture onto each mustard-coated toast, then top with the 4 oz grated or thinly sliced Swiss cheese. Grating helps it melt faster. 7. Put the toasts under the broiler for 1 to 3 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly, watch it closely so it doesn’t burn. 8. Remove, sprinkle with 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, let cool a minute and serve. A little extra drizzle of olive oil or a quick squeeze of lemon brightens it up if you want.",
