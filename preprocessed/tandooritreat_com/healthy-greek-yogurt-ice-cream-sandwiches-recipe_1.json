    "instructions": "1. Preheat oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper, then whisk together 1 cup whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup rolled oats, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon if you want it. 2. In a bowl cream 6 tablespoons softened unsalted butter with 1/3 cup packed brown sugar until light, then beat in 1 large egg and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, it’s okay if it’s a little shaggy. 3. Fold the dry mix into the butter mixture until just combined, chill the dough 15 to 30 minutes so the cookies don’t spread too much while baking. 4. Scoop tablespoon sized portions of dough onto the prepared sheet, flatten them slightly so they bake evenly, bake about 10 to 12 minutes or until edges are set, then cool completely on a wire rack because warm cookies will melt the filling. 5. While cookies cool make the yogurt filling: in a blender or food processor combine 2 cups plain Greek yogurt, 1 cup chopped fresh strawberries, 1/3 cup honey or maple syrup, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Blend until smooth or pulse a few times if you like strawberry bits. 6. Sweetness check, taste and add a little more honey if needed, then either churn the mixture in an ice cream maker for about 20 minutes and transfer to a container to freeze until firm, or for no-machine method pour into a shallow container and freeze, stirring vigorously every 30 minutes until scoopable, about 2 to 3 hours. 7. When the filling is firm but scoopable, place about 2 tablespoons or a generous scoop on the flat side of one cookie, top with another cookie and press gently to make a sandwich, you can also layer in a thin slice of fresh strawberry if you like extra fruit. 8. Put assembled sandwiches on a tray and place in the freezer for 30 to 60 minutes to set, then store in an airtight container with parchment between layers for up to a week.",

    "notes": "Use a piping bag or a zip top bag with the corner snipped to get even amounts of filling, cool cookies completely before assembling, press the edges into extra oats or crushed cookie crumbs for a rustic look, and let sandwiches sit 5 minutes at room temperature before eating so they soften just a bit.",
