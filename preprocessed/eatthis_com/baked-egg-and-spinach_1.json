    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 375°F. Heat the oil in a large skillet set over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for about 3 minutes, until translucent. Add the mushrooms and cook for about 5 minutes, until lightly browned. Stir in the bacon, spinach, and chiles, and cook for a few minutes, until the spinach is heated through. If any water from the spinach accumulates in the pan, carefully drain. Season with salt and pepper. Divide the mixture among 4 6-ounce oven-safe ramekins that have been lightly greased with butter. Carefully crack an egg into each, making sure to keep the yolks intact. Place the ramekins in a baking dish and bake until the whites are just set but the yolks are still runny, about 10 minutes.",
