    "notes": "The ginisang gulay can be made up of other vegetables, too, if you’re not keen on the mix that is listed here! Swap out the sitaw for green peas or Baguio beans. Add carrots or use that as a replacement for the bell peppers. You can also add a can of sweet kernel corn to this veggie mix, a great idea since it marries well with the gata and the bagoong, too.",
